# Wayflyer launch button

> A reusable launch button which is responsible for the ignition of the rocket fuel that will send Wayflyer's rocket ship to the stars.

## **Notes**

First off, I really enjoyed this tech task - well thought out!

I haven't developed with typescript in nearly 2 years (current company doesn't use it widely), so I'm sadly quite rusty in this regard. If I was to come onboard with Wayflyer, I'd spend time beforehand getting back up to speed with TS. Hopefully I didn't make too much of a mess!

## **Tech**

### Rollup JS

Seeing as this was going to be a component wrapped in a component library I decided to give **Rollup** a try as I've heard about it being a great way to build component libraries.

In retrospect - I probably should have played it safe and just used Webpack 5.

## **Accessibility**

Some notes around accessibility

### Storybook A11y

As part of the storybook implementation I've included an AXE(A11y) plugin which automatically scans components / stories to raise any violations, passes and incompleted a11y items.

When on a story, refresh the page and you will find the accessibility tab in the lower bar updated with the results of the A11Y scan done by the plugin.

### General A11y

I've worked to ensure that the button can inform users which are leveraging a screen reader (albeit not quite perfect - more details after) and also ensure it is usable with keyboard.

-   One small issue I came across with the screen reader. I wanted to inform the user about changes to the dynamic content within the tooltip (which describes the buttons functionality). For some reason, the screen reader repeats the tooltip text twice. I've tried a variety of tricks I usually leverage for dynamic content but alas... it just wouldn't play nice for me.

-   I also wanted to note that some of the colors provided as part of the design spec aren't WCAG compliant in terms of contrast between background and foreground. Working color has a contrast ratio of ~2.6 (working) and Error sits at ~4.0. The WCAG contrast minimum is 4.5.
    The closest accessible alternative text colors we could use to maintain the white background are;

    -   `#C75300` instead of `#FF7900`
    -   `#EE0700` instead of `#FF0000`.

    I didn't implement the above color changes as the requirements stated to match the designs closely. This is something I would of normally raise with design to update our theme colours for example and perhaps do a general accessibility check on our palette. Then make the code change.

### Testing

Code almost to 100% - tiny little nullish check that I didn't want to duplicate a load of tests for.
